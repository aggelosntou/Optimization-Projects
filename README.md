# Vehicle Route Optimization

## Overview
This project implements a delivery route optimization solution using Python, leveraging OpenRouteService and Folium for map visualization. It processes delivery data from an Excel file, calculates optimized routes for two different days, and visualizes these routes on an interactive map.
